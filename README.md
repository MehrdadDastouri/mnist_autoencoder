project:
  name: "Deep Q-Learning for CartPole using PyTorch"
  description: "This project demonstrates how to train an agent to balance a pole on a cart using Deep Q-Learning (DQN) with PyTorch. The agent interacts with the environment, learns from its experiences, and improves over time."

features:
  - "Implements Deep Q-Learning with:"
  - "Replay Memory for stable training."
  - "Target Network for stable Q-value updates."
  - "Epsilon-Greedy strategy for exploration and exploitation."
  - "Trains the agent on the CartPole-v1 environment from OpenAI Gym."
  - "Visualizes:"
  - "Rewards over episodes."
  - "Agent's performance in a test episode."
